    "## What's Reinforcement Learning? \n",
    "\n",
    "In general **Reinforcement Learning**  is just another machine learning method, which is based on rewarding desired actions/output and punishing for the undesired ones. Reinforcement learning models, just like people, are choosing which action to make based on the expected return of each action. You must give your model some input which include the information about current situation and possible actions, then you must reward it based on the decision that it decides to make. Reinforcement learning models learn to perform a task through repeated trial and error interactions with an environment and does so without any human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent**: is your reinforcement learning model, it's a decision maker and learner. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment**: is a world around your agent, agent learns and acts inside of it. The environment takes the action provided by the agent and returns the next\n",
    "**state** and the **reward**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**State**: is a complete description of the state of the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Action**: is a way agent interacts with the environment. **Aciton Space** is the set of all possible actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reward**: is a feedback from the environment, it can be negative or positive. It impacts the agent and serves as an indication to an agent of what it should achieve. Rewards are generally unknown and agents learn how to correctly estimate the rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy**: is a rule used by an agent to decide what actions to take, given the specific state. It works as a map from state to some action can sometimes be defined as a set of probabilities for each action in the action space. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Function**: is the function that returns the expected total reward your agent can get from following the specific policy. The agent uses this value function to make decisions and learns by updating the expected reward values of the parameters of this function. In this lab we will be using state-action value function, so our function $Q(s,a)$ will take state-action pair and will return an estimated reward for taking action $a$ from state $s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning Process\n",
    "1. Agent plays a number of games\n",
    "2. In every game, agent chooses an **Action** form the action space by using **Policy** and **Value Function**\n",
    "3. **Action** impacts the environment and the **Reward** and the new **State** is returned to the agent.\n",
    "4. Agent keeps track of what reward it received after choosing a certain action from a certain set. \n",
    "5. After completing the game, the agent updates the estimated reward for each state and action by using the actual rewards values received while playing the game. \n",
    "6. The whole process repeats again.\n",

    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Method was invented by Stanislaw Ulman in 1940s, while trying to calculate the probability of a successful Canfield solitaire (He was sick and had nothing better to do). Ulman randomly lay the cards out and simply calculated the number of successful plays. We will apply the same approach to create our value function. The basic principle of Monte Carlo method can be summarized in 4 steps: \n",

    "2. Generate inputs randomly from a probability distribution over the domain\n",
    "3. Perform a deterministic computation on the inputs\n",

    "Monte Carlo reinforcement learning learns from **episodes of experience**, it functions by setting the value function equal to the empirical mean return.\n",

We add the initial return $R_1$ as it is, without modifying the value, then to get the total reward we are adding $R_{t+1}$ but note that the value is multiplied by $0\\leq \\gamma \\leq 1$, so $R_{t+1}$ is only partially added to $R_1$, $R_{t+2}$ is multiplied by $\\gamma^2$, $R_{t+3}$ is multiplied by $\\gamma^3$ and so on.
